## Numeric summaries of groups

In the previous lesson we looked at some visualisations of the data that suggested that there
might be differences between some of the groups, but we would like to test this.

To start, we might want to look at the different groups in numbers. We can use one of the
`tidyverse` packages, `dplyr`, to calculate these numbers.


~~~
library(tidyverse)

pattani %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(blood_lead), sd = sd(blood_lead))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 1 x 2
   mean    sd
  <dbl> <dbl>
1    NA   NaN
~~~
{: .output}

We don't get any results! Remember that the `blood_lead` variable had some missing values. By
default, the functions `mean` and `sd` will not give you a result if the input has missing
values. We can ask the functions to ignore them by using the argument `na.rm = TRUE`.


~~~
pattani %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(blood_lead, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(blood_lead, na.rm = TRUE))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 1 x 2
   mean    sd
  <dbl> <dbl>
1  12.0  4.34
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Naming the arguments in `summarise`
>
> It isn't necessary to name the arguments in `summarise` but it makes the output neater.
{: .callout}

These give us the mean and standard deviation for the entire variable, but we want to split
that up by some other variables. For this we will use the `group_by` function.


~~~
pattani %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(blood_lead, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(blood_lead, na.rm = TRUE))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 2 x 3
  gender  mean    sd
  <fct>  <dbl> <dbl>
1 Boy     12.4  4.57
2 Girl    11.7  4.11
~~~
{: .output}

Or by school:


~~~
pattani %>%
  group_by(school) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(blood_lead, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(blood_lead, na.rm = TRUE))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 5 x 3
  school      mean    sd
  <fct>      <dbl> <dbl>
1 Tangkadeng  8.48  2.31
2 Thamthalu  16.5   4.32
3 Tachi      12.9   4.03
4 Tesabal 3  15.2   3.32
5 Sabarang   11.6   2.92
~~~
{: .output}

You can also do both:


~~~
pattani %>%
  group_by(gender, school) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(blood_lead, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(blood_lead, na.rm = TRUE))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 10 x 4
# Groups:   gender [2]
   gender school      mean    sd
   <fct>  <fct>      <dbl> <dbl>
 1 Boy    Tangkadeng  8.72  2.24
 2 Boy    Thamthalu  17.6   4.66
 3 Boy    Tachi      13.4   4.18
 4 Boy    Tesabal 3  15.3   2.60
 5 Boy    Sabarang   11.7   3.07
 6 Girl   Tangkadeng  8.22  2.38
 7 Girl   Thamthalu  14.8   3.25
 8 Girl   Tachi      12.6   3.92
 9 Girl   Tesabal 3  15.1   3.95
10 Girl   Sabarang   11.5   2.87
~~~
{: .output}

## Testing the difference between 2 groups

Going back to the difference by gender,


~~~
pattani %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(blood_lead, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(blood_lead, na.rm = TRUE))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 2 x 3
  gender  mean    sd
  <fct>  <dbl> <dbl>
1 Boy     12.4  4.57
2 Girl    11.7  4.11
~~~
{: .output}

We can see that the means of the boys are similar to the means of the girls, but we would like
to formally test if they are statistically different from each other. One way to do this is
with a **_t_ test**.

The question we are asking is **Is the mean blood lead level for the boys different to the mean
blood lead level for the girls?** Formally, we could say:

$$H_0: \mu_{boys} = \mu_{girls} \\
H_1: \mu_{boys} \neq \mu_{girls}$$


~~~
t.test(blood_lead ~ gender, data = pattani)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  blood_lead by gender
t = 1.5858, df = 410.97, p-value = 0.1136
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.1594838  1.4905952
sample estimates:
 mean in group Boy mean in group Girl 
          12.40049           11.73493 
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that the means shown for each group are the same as what we calculated earlier. The
**alternative hypothesis** is that the **difference in means is not equal to 0**, as we
mentioned.
